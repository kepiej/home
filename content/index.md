# About me

I am a researcher in the Data & Analytics Competence Center at the Flemish Institute of Technological Research (VITO) in Mol (Belgium).
Previously, I worked at the [Federal Planning Bureau](https://www.plan.be) as an IT expert and assisted with the demographic projections. I also spent some time as a data science consultant at [Tropos.io](https://tropos.io). 
I have an academic background in computer science (BSc), mathematical engineering (MSc) and economics (MSc + PhD). I also spent 2 years as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Food and Resource Economics](https://ifro.ku.dk/english/) at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. A complete list of my publications is [[Publications|here]].
